    <h1>What is Coast FIRE? A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Financial Independence</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p><strong>Coast FIRE</strong> is one of the most exciting and realistic paths within the Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement. Instead of pushing for complete financial independence as quickly as possible, Coast FIRE focuses on building a strong foundation early in life and then allowing your investments to ‚Äúcoast‚Äù toward retirement. This approach reduces pressure, improves lifestyle balance, and gives you freedom much sooner than traditional retirement plans.</p>

    <h2>üîé Understanding Coast FIRE</h2>
    <p>At its core, Coast FIRE is simple: if you invest enough money early on, compound interest does the heavy lifting. Once you‚Äôve saved your <strong>Coast FIRE number</strong>‚Äîthe amount that, if left untouched, will grow into your full retirement fund‚Äîyou no longer need to contribute aggressively. Your financial independence is secured in the background while you focus on living in the present.</p>

    <blockquote>Think of Coast FIRE as planting a financial tree early in life. Once the roots are deep enough, it grows on its own without extra effort.</blockquote>

    <h2>‚öñÔ∏è Coast FIRE vs. Other FIRE Paths</h2>
    <p>The FIRE movement includes several variations. Here‚Äôs how Coast FIRE compares:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lean FIRE</strong>: Living frugally with a smaller nest egg. Requires constant cost-cutting.</li>
      <li><strong>Fat FIRE</strong>: Aiming for luxury retirement with a large portfolio. Requires very high savings rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Coast FIRE</strong>: Strikes a middle ground. You save early, let compounding take over, and enjoy more freedom in your working years.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üìà How Does Coast FIRE Work in Practice?</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Save Aggressively Early</h3>
    <p>During your 20s or 30s, contribute heavily to investments‚Äîideally 30% to 50% of your income. The earlier you start, the less total you need to save.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Reach Your Coast FIRE Number</h3>
    <p>This is the point where your portfolio can grow to your full retirement target by age 60‚Äì65 without additional contributions.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Coast!</h3>
    <p>Once you‚Äôve hit the Coast FIRE milestone, you only need to cover current living expenses. You can take lower-paying but fulfilling jobs, work part-time, or even take career breaks without jeopardizing your retirement.</p>

    <h2>üßÆ How to Calculate Your Coast FIRE Number</h2>
    <p>Your Coast FIRE number depends on three main factors:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Your desired annual retirement expenses.</li>
      <li>The number of years until retirement.</li>
      <li>Expected annual investment growth rate (typically 5‚Äì7%).</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Work becomes optional, not mandatory.</li>
      <li><strong>Peace of Mind:</strong> Knowing retirement is secured reduces stress.</li>
      <li><strong>Work-Life Balance:</strong> Allows career changes or part-time work without guilt.</li>
      <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Reaching Coast FIRE early keeps you financially disciplined.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges of Coast FIRE</h2>
    <p>Of course, there are some drawbacks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Requires significant savings early in your career.</li>
      <li>Markets may underperform, extending timelines.</li>
      <li>Inflation can reduce purchasing power over decades.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üß† Psychology of Coast FIRE</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest benefits of Coast FIRE is mental freedom. Knowing that your future is secured removes financial anxiety. Many people in Coast FIRE say they feel more relaxed at work, more adventurous in life choices, and less pressured by money.</p>

    <h2>üåç Is Coast FIRE Right for You?</h2>
    <p>Coast FIRE isn‚Äôt one-size-fits-all. It works best for people who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can save aggressively in their 20s or 30s.</li>
      <li>Value freedom and flexibility over retiring extremely early.</li>
      <li>Want to balance financial independence with enjoying life along the way.</li>
